### Custom Agent Usage

```typescript
// Game logic review
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  agentConfig: 'agents/game-logic-reviewer.md',
  prompt: 'Review TradingScene.ts for multiplayer reliability issues',
})

// Web3 audit
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  agentConfig: 'agents/web3-auditor.md',
  prompt: 'Review LiquidityVault.sol for security and gas optimization',
})
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Starting work?
├─ Creative/feature? → brainstorming
├─ Bug/test failure? → systematic-debugging
├─ Have spec? → writing-plans → executing-plans
└─ Not sure? → using-superpowers

Need parallel work?
└─ dispatching-parallel-agents

Done with code?
├─ verification-before-completion
└─ requesting-code-review → receiving-code-review

Done with feature branch?
└─ finishing-a-development-branch
```
